Q1.Why is list used?
Ans.
Lists are one of the four built-in data structures in Python, together with tuples, dictionaries, and sets. 
They are used to store an ordered collection of items, which might be of different types but usually they aren’t. 
Commas separate the elements that are contained within a list and enclosed in square brackets.
Since lists in Python store ordered collections of items or objects, we can say that they are sequence types, precisely 
because they behave like a sequence.
One main benefit of using a list in Python is that it’s a single tool that you can use in many different situations. 
In addition to standard list creation, list comprehensions can be used for mapping and filtering. 
We don’t have to use a different approach for each scenario.

Q2.How do lists and sets differ?
Ans.
Lists and sets differ in the following ways:
1)Just like dictionaries, sets have no order in their collection of items. Not like lists.
2)Set requires the items contained in it to be hashable, lists store non-hashable items.
3)Sets require your items to be unique and immutable. 
Duplicates are not allowed in sets, while lists allow for duplicates and are mutable.

Q3.Application of dictionaries with a real world example.
Ans.
Data storage - so instead of remembering that a person’s name is at list index 0, 
and the address is at list index 1.We can create a dictionary with keys of 
‘name’ and ‘address’. This makes our code more readable and helps to identify record
easily and efficiently rather than remembering each and every record.
