# codewayy_python_series
This repository contains series of python tasks starting from the very basics
to an advanced level.
Starting with Tas1 assigned by codewayy:
## Task1:
This consists of performing operations on integer and float values annd the use of string concatenation.
This task has helped us to understand the various operations on datatypes like integer and float and 
the use of string concatenation with the help of examples.
## Task2:
This consists of slicing and indexing of lists and strings in python and the concept of lists,sets,dictionaries and tuples.
This task has helped us to learn the usage and working of lists,sets,tuples and dictionaries in python. 
It has given us the knowledge of various methods and functions that are available in these four in-built data structures. 
These data structures in python provides numerous real-world applications to us.
### I hope this series will enhance my knowledge and skills.
